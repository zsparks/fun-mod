Ideas that we've had so far:

- Want to choose a language/languages to explain things in!
  - Some kind of ML (SML or OCaml) for the legit module system
  - Java too, for accessibility
  - Haskell for the haskellers who care about this kind of thing

- Examples?
  - Adapt the Reynolds parametricity story
    - Probably don't want it to be about nerds 'n complex numbers

===== OUTLINE =====

Abstract should motivate modularity?

Intro: "Modularity Modulo Objects"
  - Assume people already *want* modularity
  - Answer the usual question "if you hate OO, how do you do modularity?"
  - Teach people that *modularity is not painful*
